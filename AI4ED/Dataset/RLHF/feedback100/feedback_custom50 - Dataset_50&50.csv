"An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.
 
 For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 
 
 You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.

"You have a long fence which consists of $n$ sections. Unfortunately, it is not painted, so you decided to hire $q$ painters to paint it. $i$-th painter will paint all sections $x$ such that $l_i \le x \le r_i$.
 
 Unfortunately, you are on a tight budget, so you may hire only $q - 2$ painters. Obviously, only painters you hire will do their work.
 
 You want to maximize the number of painted sections if you choose $q - 2$ painters optimally. A section is considered painted if at least one painter paints it.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($3 \le n, q \le 5000$) ‚Äî the number of sections and the number of painters availible for hire, respectively.
 
 Then $q$ lines follow, each describing one of the painters: $i$-th line contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$).

"Jamie loves sleeping. One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly hh: mm. However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.
 
 A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.
 
 Note that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at hh: mm.
 
 Formally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer y such that the time representation of the time x¬∑y minutes before hh: mm contains the digit '7'.
 
 Jamie uses 24-hours clock, so after 23: 59 comes 00: 00.

"Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?
 
 Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!
 
 The storehouse is represented as matrix n √ó m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.
 
 Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 
 
 Note that in all conditions A ‚â† B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.
 
 The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} ‚Äî to the right, cnt_{t} ‚Äî to the top and cnt_{b} ‚Äî to the bottom.
 
 Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.
 
 Output the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains one integer number d (1 ‚â§ d ‚â§ 10^5) ‚Äî the number of sofas in the storehouse.
 
 The second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ‚â§ n, m ‚â§ 10^5) ‚Äî the size of the storehouse.
 
 Next d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ‚â§ x_1, x_2 ‚â§ n, 1 ‚â§ y_1, y_2 ‚â§ m) ‚Äî coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1) ‚â† (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.
 
 The last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ‚â§ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ‚â§ d - 1).

 Let's consider the second example. The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below). The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0. The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 
 
 So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.
 
 In the third example The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1. The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 
 
 And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.","from sys import stdin, stdout

"Let's suppose you have an array a, a stack s (initially empty) and an array b (also initially empty).
 
 You may perform the following operations until both a and s are empty:
 
  Take the first element of a, push it into s and remove it from a (if a is not empty); Take the top element from s, append it to the end of array b and remove it from s (if s is not empty). 
 
 You can perform these operations in arbitrary order.
 
 If there exists a way to perform the operations such that array b is sorted in non-descending order in the end, then array a is called stack-sortable.
 
 For example, [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable, because b will be sorted if we perform the following operations:
 
  Remove 3 from a and push it into s; Remove 1 from a and push it into s; Remove 1 from s and append it to the end of b; Remove 2 from a and push it into s; Remove 2 from s and append it to the end of b; Remove 3 from s and append it to the end of b. 
 
 After all these operations b = [1, 2, 3], so [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable. [2, 3, 1] is not stack-sortable.
 
 You are given k first elements of some permutation p of size n (recall that a permutation of size n is an array of size n where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once). You have to restore the remaining n - k elements of this permutation so it is stack-sortable. If there are multiple answers, choose the answer such that p is lexicographically maximal (an array q is lexicographically greater than an array p iff there exists some integer k such that for every i < k q_{i} = p_{i}, and q_{k} > p_{k}). You may not swap or change any of first k elements of the permutation.
 
 Print the lexicographically maximal permutation p you can obtain.
 
 If there exists no answer then output -1.

 The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 200000, 1 ‚â§ k < n) ‚Äî the size of a desired permutation, and the number of elements you are given, respectively.
 
 The second line contains k integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k} (1 ‚â§ p_{i} ‚â§ n) ‚Äî the first k elements of p. These integers are pairwise distinct.

  [Image] 
 
 It is currently hh:mm, given in a 24-hour format. As you know, Karen loves palindromes, and she believes that it is good luck to wake up when the time is a palindrome.
 
 What is the minimum number of minutes she should sleep, such that, when she wakes up, the time is a palindrome?
 
 Remember that a palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For instance, 05:39 is not a palindrome, because 05:39 backwards is 93:50. On the other hand, 05:50 is a palindrome, because 05:50 backwards is 05:50.

"Nicholas has an array a that contains n distinct integers from 1 to n. In other words, Nicholas has a permutation of size n.
 
 Nicholas want the minimum element (integer 1) and the maximum element (integer n) to be as far as possible from each other. He wants to perform exactly one swap in order to maximize the distance between the minimum and the maximum elements. The distance between two elements is considered to be equal to the absolute difference between their positions.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 100)¬†‚Äî the size of the permutation.
 
 The second line of the input contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ‚â§ a_{i} ‚â§ n), where a_{i} is equal to the element at the i-th position.

"You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.
 
 Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation: add a character to the end of the string. 
 
 Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.
 
 For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.
 
 If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

"ZS the Coder has recently found an interesting concept called the Birthday Paradox. It states that given a random set of 23 people, there is around 50% chance that some two of them share the same birthday. ZS the Coder finds this very interesting, and decides to test this with the inhabitants of Udayland.
 
 In Udayland, there are 2^{n} days in a year. ZS the Coder wants to interview k people from Udayland, each of them has birthday in one of 2^{n} days (each day with equal probability). He is interested in the probability of at least two of them have the birthday at the same day. 
 
 ZS the Coder knows that the answer can be written as an irreducible fraction $\frac{A}{B}$. He wants to find the values of A and B (he does not like to deal with floating point numbers). Can you help him?
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first and only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10^18, 2 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 10^18), meaning that there are 2^{n} days in a year and that ZS the Coder wants to interview exactly k people.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 If the probability of at least two k people having the same birthday in 2^{n} days long year equals $\frac{A}{B}$ (A ‚â• 0, B ‚â• 1, $\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) = 1$), print the A and B in a single line.
 
 Since these numbers may be too large, print them modulo 10^6 + 3. Note that A and B must be coprime before their remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 are taken.

 In the first sample case, there are 2^3 = 8 days in Udayland. The probability that 2 people have the same birthday among 2 people is clearly $\frac{1}{8}$, so A = 1, B = 8.
 
 In the second sample case, there are only 2^1 = 2 days in Udayland, but there are 3 people, so it is guaranteed that two of them have the same birthday. Thus, the probability is 1 and A = B = 1.","m = 10** 6 + 3

"Running with barriers on the circle track is very popular in the country where Dasha lives, so no wonder that on her way to classes she saw the following situation:
 
 The track is the circle with length L, in distinct points of which there are n barriers. Athlete always run the track in counterclockwise direction if you look on him from above. All barriers are located at integer distance from each other along the track. 
 
 Her friends the parrot Kefa and the leopard Sasha participated in competitions and each of them ran one lap. Each of the friends started from some integral point on the track. Both friends wrote the distance from their start along the track to each of the n barriers. Thus, each of them wrote n integers in the ascending order, each of them was between 0 and L - 1, inclusively. [Image] Consider an example. Let L = 8, blue points are barriers, and green points are Kefa's start (A) and Sasha's start (B). Then Kefa writes down the sequence [2, 4, 6], and Sasha writes down [1, 5, 7]. 
 
 There are several tracks in the country, all of them have same length and same number of barriers, but the positions of the barriers can differ among different tracks. Now Dasha is interested if it is possible that Kefa and Sasha ran the same track or they participated on different tracks. 
 
 Write the program which will check that Kefa's and Sasha's tracks coincide (it means that one can be obtained from the other by changing the start position). Note that they always run the track in one direction ‚Äî counterclockwise, if you look on a track from above. 
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 50, n ‚â§ L ‚â§ 100) ‚Äî the number of barriers on a track and its length. 
 
 The second line contains n distinct integers in the ascending order ‚Äî the distance from Kefa's start to each barrier in the order of its appearance. All integers are in the range from 0 to L - 1 inclusively.
 
 The second line contains n distinct integers in the ascending order ‚Äî the distance from Sasha's start to each barrier in the order of its overcoming. All integers are in the range from 0 to L - 1 inclusively.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 Print ""YES"" (without quotes), if Kefa and Sasha ran the coinciding tracks (it means that the position of all barriers coincides, if they start running from the same points on the track). Otherwise print ""NO"" (without quotes).

The top level consists of only 1 glass, that stands on 2 glasses on the second level (counting from the top), then 3 glasses on the third level and so on.The bottom level consists of n glasses.
 
 Vlad has seen in the movies many times how the champagne beautifully flows from top levels to bottom ones, filling all the glasses simultaneously. So he took a bottle and started to pour it in the glass located at the top of the pyramid.
 
 Each second, Vlad pours to the top glass the amount of champagne equal to the size of exactly one glass. If the glass is already full, but there is some champagne flowing in it, then it pours over the edge of the glass and is equally distributed over two glasses standing under. If the overflowed glass is at the bottom level, then the champagne pours on the table. For the purpose of this problem we consider that champagne is distributed among pyramid glasses immediately.

"A new airplane SuperPuperJet has an infinite number of rows, numbered with positive integers starting with 1 from cockpit to tail. There are six seats in each row, denoted with letters from 'a' to 'f'. Seats 'a', 'b' and 'c' are located to the left of an aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit), while seats 'd', 'e' and 'f' are located to the right. Seats 'a' and 'f' are located near the windows, while seats 'c' and 'd' are located near the aisle. [Image] 
 
 ¬†
 
 It's lunch time and two flight attendants have just started to serve food. They move from the first rows to the tail, always maintaining a distance of two rows from each other because of the food trolley. Thus, at the beginning the first attendant serves row 1 while the second attendant serves row 3. When both rows are done they move one row forward: the first attendant serves row 2 while the second attendant serves row 4. Then they move three rows forward and the first attendant serves row 5 while the second attendant serves row 7. Then they move one row forward again and so on.
 
 Flight attendants work with the same speed: it takes exactly 1 second to serve one passenger and 1 second to move one row forward. Each attendant first serves the passengers on the seats to the right of the aisle and then serves passengers on the seats to the left of the aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit). Moreover, they always serve passengers in order from the window to the aisle. Thus, the first passenger to receive food in each row is located in seat 'f', and the last one¬†‚Äî in seat 'c'. Assume that all seats are occupied.
 
 Vasya has seat s in row n and wants to know how many seconds will pass before he gets his lunch.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The only line of input contains a description of Vasya's seat in the format ns, where n (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10^18) is the index of the row and s is the seat in this row, denoted as letter from 'a' to 'f'. The index of the row and the seat are not separated by a space.

"Berland Football Cup starts really soon! Commentators from all over the world come to the event.
 
 Organizers have already built $n$ commentary boxes. $m$ regional delegations will come to the Cup. Every delegation should get the same number of the commentary boxes. If any box is left unoccupied then the delegations will be upset. So each box should be occupied by exactly one delegation.
 
 If $n$ is not divisible by $m$, it is impossible to distribute the boxes to the delegations at the moment.
 
 Organizers can build a new commentary box paying $a$ burles and demolish a commentary box paying $b$ burles. They can both build and demolish boxes arbitrary number of times (each time paying a corresponding fee). It is allowed to demolish all the existing boxes.
 
 What is the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations (i.e. to make the number of the boxes be divisible by $m$)?
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The only line contains four integer numbers $n$, $m$, $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^{12}$, $1 \le a, b \le 100$), where $n$ is the initial number of the commentary boxes, $m$ is the number of delegations to come, $a$ is the fee to build a box and $b$ is the fee to demolish a box.

"The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.
 
 Polycarp loves to listen to music, so he never leaves the player, even on the way home from the university. Polycarp overcomes the distance from the university to the house in exactly $T$ minutes.
 
 In the player, Polycarp stores $n$ songs, each of which is characterized by two parameters: $t_i$ and $g_i$, where $t_i$ is the length of the song in minutes ($1 \le t_i \le 15$), $g_i$ is its genre ($1 \le g_i \le 3$).
 
 Polycarp wants to create such a playlist so that he can listen to music all the time on the way from the university to his home, and at the time of his arrival home, the playlist is over. Polycarp never interrupts songs and always listens to them from beginning to end. Thus, if he started listening to the $i$-th song, he would spend exactly $t_i$ minutes on its listening. Polycarp also does not like when two songs of the same genre play in a row (i.e. successively/adjacently) or when the songs in his playlist are repeated.
 
 Help Polycarpus count the number of different sequences of songs (their order matters), the total duration is exactly $T$, such that there are no two consecutive songs of the same genre in them and all the songs in the playlist are different.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $T$ ($1 \le n \le 15, 1 \le T \le 225$) ‚Äî the number of songs in the player and the required total duration, respectively.
 
 Next, the $n$ lines contain descriptions of songs: the $i$-th line contains two integers $t_i$ and $g_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 15, 1 \le g_i \le 3$) ‚Äî the duration of the $i$-th song and its genre, respectively.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 Output one integer ‚Äî the number of different sequences of songs, the total length of exactly $T$, such that there are no two consecutive songs of the same genre in them and all the songs in the playlist are different. Since the answer may be huge, output it modulo $10^9 + 7$ (that is, the remainder when dividing the quantity by $10^9 + 7$).

 In the second example, the first and second songs cannot go in succession (since they have the same genre). Thus, Polycarp can create a playlist in one of $2$ possible ways: $[1, 3, 2]$ and $[2, 3, 1]$ (indices of the songs are given).
 
 In the third example, Polycarp can make the following playlists: $[1, 2, 3]$, $[1, 3, 2]$, $[2, 1, 3]$, $[2, 3, 1]$, $[3, 1, 2]$, $[3, 2, 1]$, $[1, 4]$, $[4, 1]$, $[2, 3, 4]$ and $[4, 3, 2]$ (indices of the songs are given).","from math import factorial

 Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.
 
 You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.

"Alexander is learning how to convert numbers from the decimal system to any other, however, he doesn't know English letters, so he writes any number only as a decimal number, it means that instead of the letter A he will write the number 10. Thus, by converting the number 475 from decimal to hexadecimal system, he gets 11311 (475 = 1¬∑16^2 + 13¬∑16^1 + 11¬∑16^0). Alexander lived calmly until he tried to convert the number back to the decimal number system.
 
 Alexander remembers that he worked with little numbers so he asks to find the minimum decimal number so that by converting it to the system with the base n he will get the number k.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains the integer n (2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10^9). The second line contains the integer k (0 ‚â§ k < 10^60), it is guaranteed that the number k contains no more than 60 symbols. All digits in the second line are strictly less than n.
 
 Alexander guarantees that the answer exists and does not exceed 10^18.
 
 The number k doesn't contain leading zeros.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 Print the number x (0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 10^18)¬†‚Äî the answer to the problem.

"Consider a billiard table of rectangular size $n \times m$ with four pockets. Let's introduce a coordinate system with the origin at the lower left corner (see the picture). [Image] 
 
 There is one ball at the point $(x, y)$ currently. Max comes to the table and strikes the ball. The ball starts moving along a line that is parallel to one of the axes or that makes a $45^{\circ}$ angle with them. We will assume that: the angles between the directions of the ball before and after a collision with a side are equal, the ball moves indefinitely long, it only stops when it falls into a pocket, the ball can be considered as a point, it falls into a pocket if and only if its coordinates coincide with one of the pockets, initially the ball is not in a pocket. 
 
 Note that the ball can move along some side, in this case the ball will just fall into the pocket at the end of the side.
 
 Your task is to determine whether the ball will fall into a pocket eventually, and if yes, which of the four pockets it will be.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The only line contains $6$ integers $n$, $m$, $x$, $y$, $v_x$, $v_y$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9$, $0 \leq x \leq n$; $0 \leq y \leq m$; $-1 \leq v_x, v_y \leq 1$; $(v_x, v_y) \neq (0, 0)$)¬†‚Äî the width of the table, the length of the table, the $x$-coordinate of the initial position of the ball, the $y$-coordinate of the initial position of the ball, the $x$-component of its initial speed and the $y$-component of its initial speed, respectively. It is guaranteed that the ball is not initially in a pocket.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 Print the coordinates of the pocket the ball will fall into, or $-1$ if the ball will move indefinitely.

"Masha really loves algebra. On the last lesson, her strict teacher Dvastan gave she new exercise.
 
 You are given geometric progression b defined by two integers b_1 and q. Remind that a geometric progression is a sequence of integers b_1, b_2, b_3, ..., where for each i > 1 the respective term satisfies the condition b_{i} = b_{i} - 1¬∑q, where q is called the common ratio of the progression. Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both b_1 and q can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha m ""bad"" integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m}, and an integer l.
 
 Masha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |b_{i}| ‚â§ l is satisfied (|x| means absolute value of x). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the ""bad"" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.
 
 But the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print ""inf"" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line of input contains four integers b_1, q, l, m (-10^9 ‚â§ b_1, q ‚â§ 10^9, 1 ‚â§ l ‚â§ 10^9, 1 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 10^5)¬†‚Äî the initial term and the common ratio of progression, absolute value of maximal number that can be written on the board and the number of ""bad"" integers, respectively.
 
 The second line contains m distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m} (-10^9 ‚â§ a_{i} ‚â§ 10^9)¬†‚Äî numbers that will never be written on the board.

 Print the only integer, meaning the number of progression terms that will be written on the board if it is finite, or ""inf"" (without quotes) otherwise.

 -----Note-----
 
 In the first sample case, Masha will write integers 3, 12, 24. Progression term 6 will be skipped because it is a ""bad"" integer. Terms bigger than 24 won't be written because they exceed l by absolute value.
 
 In the second case, Masha won't write any number because all terms are equal 123 and this is a ""bad"" integer.
 
 In the third case, Masha will write infinitely integers 123.","def main():

"Innocentius has a problem ‚Äî his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are ""dead"", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.
 
 Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as ""the game is good for the imagination and attention"".
 
 Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that: the frame's width is 1 pixel, the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen, all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame, of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 
 
 Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ‚â§ n, m ‚â§ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each ‚Äî the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character ""."" (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character ""w"" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters ""+"" (the ""plus"" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as ""w"". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.
 
 If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

"There is a grass field that stretches infinitely.
 In this field, there is a negligibly small cow. Let (x, y) denote the point that is x\ \mathrm{cm} south and y\ \mathrm{cm} east of the point where the cow stands now. The cow itself is standing at (0, 0).
 There are also N north-south lines and M east-west lines drawn on the field. The i-th north-south line is the segment connecting the points (A_i, C_i) and (B_i, C_i), and the j-th east-west line is the segment connecting the points (D_j, E_j) and (D_j, F_j).
 What is the area of the region the cow can reach when it can move around as long as it does not cross the segments (including the endpoints)? If this area is infinite, print INF instead.
 
 -----Constraints-----
  - All values in input are integers between -10^9 and 10^9 (inclusive).
  - 1 \leq N, M \leq 1000
  - A_i < B_i\ (1 \leq i \leq N)
  - E_j < F_j\ (1 \leq j \leq M)

"The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!
 
 One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.
 
 It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.
 
 Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains the integer n (4 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 255)¬†‚Äî the length of the genome.
 
 The second line contains the string s of length n¬†‚Äî the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: ""==="" (without quotes).

"Ilya is an experienced player in tic-tac-toe on the 4 √ó 4 field. He always starts and plays with Xs. He played a lot of games today with his friend Arseny. The friends became tired and didn't finish the last game. It was Ilya's turn in the game when they left it. Determine whether Ilya could have won the game by making single turn or not. 
 
 The rules of tic-tac-toe on the 4 √ó 4 field are as follows. Before the first turn all the field cells are empty. The two players take turns placing their signs into empty cells (the first player places Xs, the second player places Os). The player who places Xs goes first, the another one goes second. The winner is the player who first gets three of his signs in a row next to each other (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The tic-tac-toe position is given in four lines.
 
 Each of these lines contains four characters. Each character is '.' (empty cell), 'x' (lowercase English letter x), or 'o' (lowercase English letter o). It is guaranteed that the position is reachable playing tic-tac-toe, and it is Ilya's turn now (in particular, it means that the game is not finished). It is possible that all the cells are empty, it means that the friends left without making single turn.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 Print single line: ""YES"" in case Ilya could have won by making single turn, and ""NO"" otherwise.

"The Duck song
 
 For simplicity, we'll assume that there are only three types of grapes: green grapes, purple grapes and black grapes.
 
 Andrew, Dmitry and Michal are all grapes' lovers, however their preferences of grapes are different. To make all of them happy, the following should happen: Andrew, Dmitry and Michal should eat at least $x$, $y$ and $z$ grapes, respectively. Andrew has an extreme affinity for green grapes, thus he will eat green grapes and green grapes only. On the other hand, Dmitry is not a fan of black grapes¬†‚Äî any types of grapes except black would do for him. In other words, Dmitry can eat green and purple grapes. Michal has a common taste¬†‚Äî he enjoys grapes in general and will be pleased with any types of grapes, as long as the quantity is sufficient.
 
 Knowing that his friends are so fond of grapes, Aki decided to host a grape party with them. He has prepared a box with $a$ green grapes, $b$ purple grapes and $c$ black grapes.
 
 However, Aki isn't sure if the box he prepared contains enough grapes to make everyone happy. Can you please find out whether it's possible to distribute grapes so that everyone is happy or Aki has to buy some more grapes?
 
 It is not required to distribute all the grapes, so it's possible that some of them will remain unused.

"Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.
 
 Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.
 
 For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2¬∑k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.
 
 Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10^5, 0 ‚â§ f ‚â§ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.
 
 Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ‚â§ k_{i}, l_{i} ‚â§ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.

 In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second¬†‚Äî 5, on the third¬†‚Äî 2, on the fourth¬†‚Äî 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

"You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.
 
 The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.
 
 As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().

There are three types of copybook's packs in the shop: it is possible to buy one copybook for a rubles, a pack of two copybooks for b rubles, and a pack of three copybooks for c rubles. Alyona already has n copybooks.
 
 What is the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4? There are infinitely many packs of any type in the shop. Alyona can buy packs of different type in the same purchase.

"Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network. 
 
 But yesterday, he came to see ""her"" in the real world and found out ""she"" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.
 
 This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.

"Unlucky year in Berland is such a year that its number n can be represented as n = x^{a} + y^{b}, where a and b are non-negative integer numbers. 
 
 For example, if x = 2 and y = 3 then the years 4 and 17 are unlucky (4 = 2^0 + 3^1, 17 = 2^3 + 3^2 = 2^4 + 3^0) and year 18 isn't unlucky as there is no such representation for it.
 
 Such interval of years that there are no unlucky years in it is called The Golden Age.
 
 You should write a program which will find maximum length of The Golden Age which starts no earlier than the year l and ends no later than the year r. If all years in the interval [l, r] are unlucky then the answer is 0.

"Mr. Funt now lives in a country with a very specific tax laws. The total income of mr. Funt during this year is equal to n (n ‚â• 2) burles and the amount of tax he has to pay is calculated as the maximum divisor of n (not equal to n, of course). For example, if n = 6 then Funt has to pay 3 burles, while for n = 25 he needs to pay 5 and if n = 2 he pays only 1 burle.
 
 As mr. Funt is a very opportunistic person he wants to cheat a bit. In particular, he wants to split the initial n in several parts n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_{k} = n (here k is arbitrary, even k = 1 is allowed) and pay the taxes for each part separately.

Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.
 
 By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point.

"Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?
 
 Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!
 
 The storehouse is represented as matrix n √ó m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.
 
 Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 
 
 Note that in all conditions A ‚â† B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.
 
 The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} ‚Äî to the right, cnt_{t} ‚Äî to the top and cnt_{b} ‚Äî to the bottom.
 
 Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.
 
 Output the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.

 Let's consider the second example. The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below). The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0. The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 
 
 So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.
 
 In the third example The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1. The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 
 
 And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.","from sys import stdin, stdout

"Let's suppose you have an array a, a stack s (initially empty) and an array b (also initially empty).
 
 You may perform the following operations until both a and s are empty:
 
  Take the first element of a, push it into s and remove it from a (if a is not empty); Take the top element from s, append it to the end of array b and remove it from s (if s is not empty). 
 
 You can perform these operations in arbitrary order.
 
 If there exists a way to perform the operations such that array b is sorted in non-descending order in the end, then array a is called stack-sortable.
 
 For example, [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable, because b will be sorted if we perform the following operations:
 
  Remove 3 from a and push it into s; Remove 1 from a and push it into s; Remove 1 from s and append it to the end of b; Remove 2 from a and push it into s; Remove 2 from s and append it to the end of b; Remove 3 from s and append it to the end of b. 
 
 After all these operations b = [1, 2, 3], so [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable. [2, 3, 1] is not stack-sortable.
 
 You are given k first elements of some permutation p of size n (recall that a permutation of size n is an array of size n where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once). You have to restore the remaining n - k elements of this permutation so it is stack-sortable. If there are multiple answers, choose the answer such that p is lexicographically maximal (an array q is lexicographically greater than an array p iff there exists some integer k such that for every i < k q_{i} = p_{i}, and q_{k} > p_{k}). You may not swap or change any of first k elements of the permutation.
 
 Print the lexicographically maximal permutation p you can obtain.
 
 If there exists no answer then output -1.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 200000, 1 ‚â§ k < n) ‚Äî the size of a desired permutation, and the number of elements you are given, respectively.
 
 The second line contains k integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k} (1 ‚â§ p_{i} ‚â§ n) ‚Äî the first k elements of p. These integers are pairwise distinct.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 If it is possible to restore a stack-sortable permutation p of size n such that the first k elements of p are equal to elements given in the input, print lexicographically maximal such permutation.
 
 Otherwise print -1.

"You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.
 
 Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation: add a character to the end of the string. 
 
 Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.
 
 For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in 7 operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in 5 operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.
 
 If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type 4 characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.

"ZS the Coder has recently found an interesting concept called the Birthday Paradox. It states that given a random set of 23 people, there is around 50% chance that some two of them share the same birthday. ZS the Coder finds this very interesting, and decides to test this with the inhabitants of Udayland.
 
 In Udayland, there are 2^{n} days in a year. ZS the Coder wants to interview k people from Udayland, each of them has birthday in one of 2^{n} days (each day with equal probability). He is interested in the probability of at least two of them have the birthday at the same day. 
 
 ZS the Coder knows that the answer can be written as an irreducible fraction $\frac{A}{B}$. He wants to find the values of A and B (he does not like to deal with floating point numbers). Can you help him?
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first and only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10^18, 2 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 10^18), meaning that there are 2^{n} days in a year and that ZS the Coder wants to interview exactly k people.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 If the probability of at least two k people having the same birthday in 2^{n} days long year equals $\frac{A}{B}$ (A ‚â• 0, B ‚â• 1, $\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) = 1$), print the A and B in a single line.
 
 Since these numbers may be too large, print them modulo 10^6 + 3. Note that A and B must be coprime before their remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 are taken.

 -----Note-----
 
 In the first sample case, there are 2^3 = 8 days in Udayland. The probability that 2 people have the same birthday among 2 people is clearly $\frac{1}{8}$, so A = 1, B = 8.
 
 In the second sample case, there are only 2^1 = 2 days in Udayland, but there are 3 people, so it is guaranteed that two of them have the same birthday. Thus, the probability is 1 and A = B = 1.","m = 10** 6 + 3

"Running with barriers on the circle track is very popular in the country where Dasha lives, so no wonder that on her way to classes she saw the following situation:
 
 The track is the circle with length L, in distinct points of which there are n barriers. Athlete always run the track in counterclockwise direction if you look on him from above. All barriers are located at integer distance from each other along the track. 
 
 Her friends the parrot Kefa and the leopard Sasha participated in competitions and each of them ran one lap. Each of the friends started from some integral point on the track. Both friends wrote the distance from their start along the track to each of the n barriers. Thus, each of them wrote n integers in the ascending order, each of them was between 0 and L - 1, inclusively. [Image] Consider an example. Let L = 8, blue points are barriers, and green points are Kefa's start (A) and Sasha's start (B). Then Kefa writes down the sequence [2, 4, 6], and Sasha writes down [1, 5, 7]. 
 
 There are several tracks in the country, all of them have same length and same number of barriers, but the positions of the barriers can differ among different tracks. Now Dasha is interested if it is possible that Kefa and Sasha ran the same track or they participated on different tracks. 
 
 Write the program which will check that Kefa's and Sasha's tracks coincide (it means that one can be obtained from the other by changing the start position). Note that they always run the track in one direction ‚Äî counterclockwise, if you look on a track from above.

"Mary has just graduated from one well-known University and is now attending celebration party. Students like to dream of a beautiful life, so they used champagne glasses to construct a small pyramid. The height of the pyramid is n. The top level consists of only 1 glass, that stands on 2 glasses on the second level (counting from the top), then 3 glasses on the third level and so on.The bottom level consists of n glasses.
 
 Vlad has seen in the movies many times how the champagne beautifully flows from top levels to bottom ones, filling all the glasses simultaneously. So he took a bottle and started to pour it in the glass located at the top of the pyramid.
 
 Each second, Vlad pours to the top glass the amount of champagne equal to the size of exactly one glass. If the glass is already full, but there is some champagne flowing in it, then it pours over the edge of the glass and is equally distributed over two glasses standing under. If the overflowed glass is at the bottom level, then the champagne pours on the table. For the purpose of this problem we consider that champagne is distributed among pyramid glasses immediately. Vlad is interested in the number of completely full glasses if he stops pouring champagne in t seconds.
 
 Pictures below illustrate the pyramid consisting of three levels. [Image] [Image]

"A new airplane SuperPuperJet has an infinite number of rows, numbered with positive integers starting with 1 from cockpit to tail. There are six seats in each row, denoted with letters from 'a' to 'f'. Seats 'a', 'b' and 'c' are located to the left of an aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit), while seats 'd', 'e' and 'f' are located to the right. Seats 'a' and 'f' are located near the windows, while seats 'c' and 'd' are located near the aisle. [Image] 
 
 ¬†
 
 It's lunch time and two flight attendants have just started to serve food. They move from the first rows to the tail, always maintaining a distance of two rows from each other because of the food trolley. Thus, at the beginning the first attendant serves row 1 while the second attendant serves row 3. When both rows are done they move one row forward: the first attendant serves row 2 while the second attendant serves row 4. Then they move three rows forward and the first attendant serves row 5 while the second attendant serves row 7. Then they move one row forward again and so on.
 
 Flight attendants work with the same speed: it takes exactly 1 second to serve one passenger and 1 second to move one row forward. Each attendant first serves the passengers on the seats to the right of the aisle and then serves passengers on the seats to the left of the aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit). Moreover, they always serve passengers in order from the window to the aisle. Thus, the first passenger to receive food in each row is located in seat 'f', and the last one¬†‚Äî in seat 'c'.

 Polycarp loves to listen to music, so he never leaves the player, even on the way home from the university. Polycarp overcomes the distance from the university to the house in exactly $T$ minutes.
 
 In the player, Polycarp stores $n$ songs, each of which is characterized by two parameters: $t_i$ and $g_i$, where $t_i$ is the length of the song in minutes ($1 \le t_i \le 15$), $g_i$ is its genre ($1 \le g_i \le 3$).
 
 Polycarp wants to create such a playlist so that he can listen to music all the time on the way from the university to his home, and at the time of his arrival home, the playlist is over. Polycarp never interrupts songs and always listens to them from beginning to end. Thus, if he started listening to the $i$-th song, he would spend exactly $t_i$ minutes on its listening. Polycarp also does not like when two songs of the same genre play in a row (i.e. successively/adjacently) or when the songs in his playlist are repeated.
 
 Help Polycarpus count the number of different sequences of songs (their order matters), the total duration is exactly $T$, such that there are no two consecutive songs of the same genre in them and all the songs in the playlist are different.

 -----Output-----
 
 Output one integer ‚Äî the number of different sequences of songs, the total length of exactly $T$, such that there are no two consecutive songs of the same genre in them and all the songs in the playlist are different.

"There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.
 
 Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.
 
 You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains a single integer n (2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10^9) ‚Äî the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 
 
 Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

 In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose: 2 and 7; 3 and 6; 4 and 5. 
 
 In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp: 1 and 8; 2 and 7; 3 and 6; 4 and 5; 5 and 14; 6 and 13; 7 and 12; 8 and 11; 9 and 10. 
 
 In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.","from sys import stdin as cin

 Professor",Your condition to check if a certain number of nines is possible is inverted. You should check if the required shovels to form the sum are within the available range 1 to n.

"Alexander is learning how to convert numbers from the decimal system to any other, however, he doesn't know English letters, so he writes any number only as a decimal number, it means that instead of the letter A he will write the number 10.

 There is one ball at the point $(x, y)$ currently. Max comes to the table and strikes the ball. The ball starts moving along a line that is parallel to one of the axes or that makes a $45^{\circ}$ angle with them. We will assume that: the angles between the directions of the ball before and after a collision with a side are equal, the ball moves indefinitely long, it only stops when it falls into a pocket, the ball can be considered as a point, it falls into a pocket if and only if its coordinates coincide with one of the pockets, initially the ball is not in a pocket. 
 
 Note that the ball can move along some side, in this case the ball will just fall into the pocket at the end of the side.

"Masha really loves algebra. On the last lesson, her strict teacher Dvastan gave she new exercise.
 
 You are given geometric progression b defined by two integers b_1 and q. Remind that a geometric progression is a sequence of integers b_1, b_2, b_3, ..., where for each i > 1 the respective term satisfies the condition b_{i} = b_{i} - 1¬∑q, where q is called the common ratio of the progression. Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both b_1 and q can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha m ""bad"" integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m}, and an integer l.
 
 Masha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |b_{i}| ‚â§ l is satisfied (|x| means absolute value of x). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the ""bad"" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.
 
 But the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print ""inf"" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.

"Innocentius has a problem ‚Äî his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are ""dead"", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.
 
 Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as ""the game is good for the imagination and attention"".
 
 Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that: the frame's width is 1 pixel, the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen, all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame, of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 
 
 Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ‚â§ n, m ‚â§ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each ‚Äî the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character ""."" (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character ""w"" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters ""+"" (the ""plus"" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as ""w"". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.
 
 If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

 Professor's feedback on the *rejected* submission:
 
 I reviewed the rejected submission and identified the likely causes for incorrect outputs:
 
 1. Missing in your rejected version: `input = sys.stdin.readline` ‚Äî This uses faster I/O which is important for large inputs; omitting it may lead to timeouts on large test cases.
 
 2. Present in your rejected version but removed in the accepted solution: `input = sys.stdin.readline` ‚Äî This line appears in your rejected submission but is not used in the accepted solution; it may be incorrect or unnecessary. Consider removing or revising it.
 
 
 Recommended corrections:
 
 1. Consider using faster I/O (`sys.stdin.readline` / `sys.stdout.write`) if the problem has large input size constraints.
 
 
 Please re-run the test cases (including edge cases) after applying these changes. If you'd like, send the updated version and I'll re-check it.
 
Professor","Your algorithm's logic is likely correct, but it may be too slow to process the largest inputs within the time limit. For problems with a large number of input lines, using the standard input() can be slow. Try replacing it with sys.stdin.readline to speed up input processing, which can often be the difference in passing these test cases.",wrong
"The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!
 
 One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.
 
 It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.
 
 Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains the integer n (4 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 255)¬†‚Äî the length of the genome.
 
 The second line contains the string s of length n¬†‚Äî the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: ""==="" (without quotes).

 In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

"Ilya is an experienced player in tic-tac-toe on the 4 √ó 4 field. He always starts and plays with Xs. He played a lot of games today with his friend Arseny. The friends became tired and didn't finish the last game. It was Ilya's turn in the game when they left it. Determine whether Ilya could have won the game by making single turn or not. 
 
 The rules of tic-tac-toe on the 4 √ó 4 field are as follows. Before the first turn all the field cells are empty. The two players take turns placing their signs into empty cells (the first player places Xs, the second player places Os). The player who places Xs goes first, the another one goes second. The winner is the player who first gets three of his signs in a row next to each other (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The tic-tac-toe position is given in four lines.
 
 Each of these lines contains four characters. Each character is '.' (empty cell), 'x' (lowercase English letter x), or 'o' (lowercase English letter o). It is guaranteed that the position is reachable playing tic-tac-toe, and it is Ilya's turn now (in particular, it means that the game is not finished). It is possible that all the cells are empty, it means that the friends left without making single turn.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 Print single line: ""YES"" in case Ilya could have won by making single turn, and ""NO"" otherwise.

"The Duck song
 
 For simplicity, we'll assume that there are only three types of grapes: green grapes, purple grapes and black grapes.
 
 Andrew, Dmitry and Michal are all grapes' lovers, however their preferences of grapes are different. To make all of them happy, the following should happen: Andrew, Dmitry and Michal should eat at least $x$, $y$ and $z$ grapes, respectively. Andrew has an extreme affinity for green grapes, thus he will eat green grapes and green grapes only. On the other hand, Dmitry is not a fan of black grapes¬†‚Äî any types of grapes except black would do for him. In other words, Dmitry can eat green and purple grapes. Michal has a common taste¬†‚Äî he enjoys grapes in general and will be pleased with any types of grapes, as long as the quantity is sufficient.
 
 Knowing that his friends are so fond of grapes, Aki decided to host a grape party with them. He has prepared a box with $a$ green grapes, $b$ purple grapes and $c$ black grapes.
 
 However, Aki isn't sure if the box he prepared contains enough grapes to make everyone happy. Can you please find out whether it's possible to distribute grapes so that everyone is happy or Aki has to buy some more grapes?
 
 It is not required to distribute all the grapes, so it's possible that some of them will remain unused.

 The first line contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ ($1 \le x, y, z \le 10^5$)¬†‚Äî the number of grapes Andrew, Dmitry and Michal want to eat.
 
 The second line contains three integers $a$, $b$, $c$ ($1 \le a, b, c \le 10^5$)¬†‚Äî the number of green, purple and black grapes in the box.

"Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.
 
 Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.
 
 For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2¬∑k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.
 
 Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10^5, 0 ‚â§ f ‚â§ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.
 
 Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ‚â§ k_{i}, l_{i} ‚â§ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.

"You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.
 
 Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 500, 1 ‚â§ m ‚â§ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) ‚Äî the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.
 
 Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ‚â§ u, v ‚â§ n, u ‚â† v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.

"Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network. 
 
 But yesterday, he came to see ""her"" in the real world and found out ""she"" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.
 
 This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters ‚Äî the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

"Unlucky year in Berland is such a year that its number n can be represented as n = x^{a} + y^{b}, where a and b are non-negative integer numbers. 
 
 For example, if x = 2 and y = 3 then the years 4 and 17 are unlucky (4 = 2^0 + 3^1, 17 = 2^3 + 3^2 = 2^4 + 3^0) and year 18 isn't unlucky as there is no such representation for it.
 
 Such interval of years that there are no unlucky years in it is called The Golden Age.
 
 You should write a program which will find maximum length of The Golden Age which starts no earlier than the year l and ends no later than the year r. If all years in the interval [l, r] are unlucky then the answer is 0.

"Mr. Funt now lives in a country with a very specific tax laws. The total income of mr. Funt during this year is equal to n (n ‚â• 2) burles and the amount of tax he has to pay is calculated as the maximum divisor of n (not equal to n, of course). For example, if n = 6 then Funt has to pay 3 burles, while for n = 25 he needs to pay 5 and if n = 2 he pays only 1 burle.
 
 As mr. Funt is a very opportunistic person he wants to cheat a bit. In particular, he wants to split the initial n in several parts n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_{k} = n (here k is arbitrary, even k = 1 is allowed) and pay the taxes for each part separately. He can't make some part equal to 1 because it will reveal him. So, the condition n_{i} ‚â• 2 should hold for all i from 1 to k.

"Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.
 
 By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point.
