Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as \"the game is good for the imagination and attention\".\n \n Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that: the frame's width is 1 pixel, the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen, all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame, of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. \n \n Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.\n \n \n -----Input-----\n \n The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 \u201a\u00e2\u00a7 n, m \u201a\u00e2\u00a7 2000).

It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.\n \n \n -----Output-----\n \n Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters \"+\" (the \"plus\" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as \"w\". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.\n \n If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.\n \n \n -----Examples-----\n Input\n 4 8\n ..w..w..\n ........\n ........\n ..w..w..\n \n Output\n ..w++w..\n ..+..+..\n ..+..+..\n ..w++w..\n \n Input\n 5 6\n ......\n .w....\n ......\n ..w...\n ......\n \n Output\n ......\n +w+...\n +.+...\n ++w...\n ......\n \n Input\n 2 4\n ....\n .w..\n \n Output\n ....\n .w..\n \n Input\n 2 6\n w..w.w\n ...w..\n \n Output\n -1\n \n \n \n -----Note-----\n \n In the first sample the required size of the optimal frame equals 4.

This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n \n Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n \n For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00ac\u2211k_{i} products.

This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n \n Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n \n For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00ac\u2211k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n \n Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products.
