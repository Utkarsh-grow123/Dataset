Polycarp overcomes the distance from the university to the house in exactly $T$ minutes.\n \n In the player, Polycarp stores $n$ songs, each of which is characterized by two parameters: $t_i$ and $g_i$, where $t_i$ is the length of the song in minutes ($1 \\le t_i \\le 15$), $g_i$ is its genre ($1 \\le g_i \\le 3$).\n \n Polycarp wants to create such a playlist so that he can listen to music all the time on the way from the university to his home, and at the time of his arrival home, the playlist is over. Polycarp never interrupts songs and always listens to them from beginning to end. Thus, if he started listening to the $i$-th song, he would spend exactly $t_i$ minutes on its listening. Polycarp also does not like when two songs of the same genre play in a row (i.e. successively/adjacently) or when the songs in his playlist are repeated.\n \n Help Polycarpus count the number of different sequences of songs (their order matters), the total duration is exactly $T$, such that there are no two consecutive songs of the same genre in them and all the songs in the playlist are different.\n \n \n -----Input-----\n \n The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $T$ ($1 \\le n \\le 15, 1 \\le T \\le 225$) ‚Äî the number of songs in the player and the required total duration, respectively.\n \n Next, the $n$ lines contain descriptions of songs: the $i$-th line contains two integers $t_i$ and $g_i$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le 15, 1 \\le g_i \\le 3$) ‚Äî the duration of the $i$-th song and its genre, respectively.\n \n \n -----Output-----\n \n Output one integer ‚Äî the number of different sequences of songs, the total length of exactly $T$, such that there are no two consecutive songs of the same genre in them and all the songs in the playlist are different. Since the answer may be huge, output it modulo $10^9 + 7$ (that is, the remainder when dividing the quantity by $10^9 + 7$).\n \n \n -----Examples-----\n Input\n 3 3\n 1 1\n 1 2\n 1 3\n \n Output\n 6\n \n Input\n 3 3\n 1 1\n 1 1\n 1 3\n \n Output\n 2\n \n Input\n 4 10\n 5 3\n 2 1\n 3 2\n 5 1\n \n Output\n 10\n \n \n \n -----Note-----\n \n In the first example, Polycarp can make any of the $6$ possible playlist by rearranging the available songs: $[1, 2, 3]$, $[1, 3, 2]$, $[2, 1, 3]$, $[2, 3, 1]$, $[3, 1, 2]$ and $[3, 2, 1]$ (indices of the songs are given).\n \n In the second example, the first and second songs cannot go in succession (since they have the same genre). Thus, Polycarp can create a playlist in one of $2$ possible ways: $[1, 3, 2]$ and $[2, 3, 1]$ (indices of the songs are given).\n \n In the third example, Polycarp can make the following playlists: $[1, 2, 3]$, $[1, 3, 2]$, $[2, 1, 3]$, $[2, 3, 1]$, $[3, 1, 2]$, $[3, 2, 1]$, $[1, 4]$, $[4, 1]$, $[2, 3, 4]$ and $[4, 3, 2]$ (indices of the songs are given).",

This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n \n Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n \n For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2¬∑k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n \n Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products.

He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.\n \n Find out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly n burles.\n \n In other words, you should find two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and x¬∑a + y¬∑b = n or tell that it's impossible.\n \n \n -----Input-----\n \n First line contains single integer n (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10 000 000)¬†‚Äî amount of money, that Vasya has.\n \n Second line contains single integer a (1 ‚â§ a ‚â§ 10 000 000)¬†‚Äî cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.\n \n Third line contains single integer b (1 ‚â§ b ‚â§ 10 000 000)¬†‚Äî cost of one Bars bar.\n \n \n -----Output-----\n \n If Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly n burles print ¬´NO¬ª (without quotes).\n \n Otherwise in first line print ¬´YES¬ª (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers x and y¬†‚Äî number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly n burles, i.e. x¬∑a + y¬∑b = n. If there are multiple answers print any of them.\n \n Any of numbers x and y can be equal 0.\n \n \n -----Examples-----\n Input\n 7\n 2\n 3\n \n Output\n YES\n 2 1\n \n Input\n 100\n 25\n 10\n \n Output\n YES\n 0 10\n \n Input\n 15\n 4\n 8\n \n Output\n NO\n \n Input\n 9960594\n 2551\n 2557\n \n Output\n YES\n 1951 1949\n \n \n \n -----Note-----\n \n In first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly 2¬∑2 + 1¬∑3 = 7 burles.\n \n In second example Vasya can spend exactly n burles multiple ways: buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and five Bars bars; buy four bottles of Ber-Cola and don't buy Bars bars; don't buy Ber-Cola and buy 10 Bars bars. \n \n In third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles.",
