"An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.
 
 For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 
 
 You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.

He will then press the snooze button every x minutes until hh: mm is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.
 
 A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit '7'. For example, 13: 07 and 17: 27 are lucky, while 00: 48 and 21: 34 are not lucky.

"Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?
 
 Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!
 
 The storehouse is represented as matrix n √ó m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.
 
 Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 
 
 Note that in all conditions A ‚â† B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.
 
 The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} ‚Äî to the right, cnt_{t} ‚Äî to the top and cnt_{b} ‚Äî to the bottom.
 
 Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.

 The second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ‚â§ n, m ‚â§ 10^5) ‚Äî the size of the storehouse.

 Let's consider the second example. The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below). The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0. The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 
 
 So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.
 
 In the third example The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1. The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 
 
 And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.","from sys import stdin, stdout

 In the first sample, Jamie needs to wake up at 11:23. So, he can set his alarm at 11:17. He would press the snooze button when the alarm rings at 11:17 and at 11:20.
 
 In the second sample, Jamie can set his alarm at exactly at 01:07 which is lucky.","x=int(input())

 Professor's feedback on the accepted submission:
 
 Good work ‚ this solution is correct for the tested cases. Strengths: Proper input parsing and type conversion.; Correct parsing of multi-value input lines..
 
 Keep documenting edge cases and include brief comments for readability.

"Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?
 
 Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!
 
 The storehouse is represented as matrix n √ó m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.
 
 Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 
 
 Note that in all conditions A ‚â† B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.
 
 The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} ‚Äî to the right, cnt_{t} ‚Äî to the top and cnt_{b} ‚Äî to the bottom.
 
 Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.
 
 Output the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.
 
 
 -----Input-----
 
 The first line contains one integer number d (1 ‚â§ d ‚â§ 10^5) ‚Äî the number of sofas in the storehouse.
 
 The second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ‚â§ n, m ‚â§ 10^5) ‚Äî the size of the storehouse.
 
 Next d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ‚â§ x_1, x_2 ‚â§ n, 1 ‚â§ y_1, y_2 ‚â§ m) ‚Äî coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1) ‚â† (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.
 
 The last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ‚â§ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ‚â§ d - 1).
 
 
 -----Output-----
 
 Print the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.

 Let's consider the second example. The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below). The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0. The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 
 
 So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.
 
 In the third example The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1. The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 
 
 And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.","from sys import stdin, stdout
